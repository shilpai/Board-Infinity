**Primary Objectives:** 

1) The title section should show a greeting statement depending on time of the day:- `Let's start our [timeOfDay] with a new quote` 

The three options to be shown in place of `timeOfDay` placeholder would be:- 

1) morning 
1) afternoon 
1) evening/night 

For example if the user opens the page in the evening the title would be as shown in the screenshot:- ![](Aspose.Words.d8f7115e-9f4e-481b-82b7-d8e950190350.005.jpeg)

**Note:** The exact time slabs for the logic behind displaying morning, evening or afternoon can be your choice. 

2) The user should be shown a different quote after clicking the **New Quote** button with a new theme in the background. 

For this create a collection of at least 10 quotes and display one of them randomly when the user clicks on the **New Quote** button. 

Also create a collection of at least 10 colors from which one color is randomly chosen and applied in the background of the page. The same color is also applied to button and quote text.
